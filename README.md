Module 6 Project
Introduction
It’s time to practice and solidify the skills you learned in this module.

Independent work

This is an individual assignment. Please do not collaborate with your peers or share your work until the project is reviewed as a class.

Setup
Click here to download the code files you need to for this project.

Navigate to the files on the command line.

Setup the app by running npm install.

Start the app by running npm run start.

Visit http://localhost:4000 your web browser and play a few games of tic-tac-toe. Familiarize yourself with how the game works. (Reload the page to play a new game.)

Open and read tictacjs.html. While it’s not important to understand every line of how the Javascript code is working in this project, take note of the different functions and what they appear to do to make the app work.

Part 1: Manual Testing
There are at least 3 known bugs in this tic tac toe game. Draft a plan to test the game, conduct your testing, and document any bugs that you find. Keep track of your testing documentation (plan and bugs) in a Google doc or something similar.

When you have finished documenting your bugs, download your document as a PDF, add it to git, and commit/push it to your Github.

Part 2: Write Automated Tests
Open and read the file called tictactoe.test.ts. There is one automated test included already.

Make sure your server is running with npm run start.

Next, in a new terminal window while your server is still running, run the tests with npm run test. You should see 1 passed in green when this command runs.

Your Task
Write at least 3 more tests for the tic-tac-toe game. Here are some ideas for tests:

Check that clicking the upper left square adds an X to the square.

Check that clicking the upper right square adds an X to the square.

Check that clicking the lower right square adds an X to the square.

[Harder] Check to see that the computer moves (adds an O) to a square after clicking on a square.

HINT: You may need to play the game a few times to figure out the logic for which square the computer will put an O into.

Part 3: Deployment Sketch
Draw a sketch/picture of deployment as it relates to the broader web application development process. Be sure to include Github, your local development environment, and the different parts of the web application on the sketch.

You should be able to come back to this picture in the future if you need a refresher on what deployment is and how to think about it in the broader picture of web application development.

Extra Credit: Stylize
Review the CSS within the <style> tags in the tictacjs.html file. Change or add to the existing CSS to make the game your own. You can change colors, font, sizing, or anything else that strikes your fancy. Feel free to use the internet or past lectures/exercises to help you write CSS.

Extra Credit: Deploy
As a last challenge, deploy the tic tac toe app using Heroku.
